/*
Blob Class
  Arraylist of pixels
  PVector center
  PVector size
  Build rect with first and last pixel(rect mode corners)


  //Taking Green Pixels
  
  
  set pixel as new blob
  check with next index of green pixel
    if distance is less than set value, add in new green pixel into blob
    else if distance is greater, create new blob with green pixel being tested
